Assignment Tasks: 
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
1. Check for Missing Values, Outliers, and Inconsistent Data.
2. Perform necessary data type conversions.
3. Handle categorical variables appropriately (e.g., encoding if needed).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
2. Univariate Analysis:
    i) Histograms (e.g., Age, AmountSpent)
   ii) Box Plots (e.g., AmountSpent by Gender or Membership)
   iii) Bar Charts for categorical variables (e.g., ProductCategory, PaymentMethod)
Bivariate Analysis:
1. Correlation Matrix and Heatmap for numeric variables.
2. Cross-tabulation (e.g., Gender vs. Returned, Membership vs. SatisfactionRating).
3. Box plots comparing AmountSpent across different Membership levels or ProductCategories.
Perform Statistical Hypothesis Testing:
1. Is there a relationship between Gender and Returned?
2. Is there a significant difference in AmountSpent between Male and Female customers? 
3. Does AmountSpent differ significantly across Membership levels?  

  Clearly state null and alternative hypotheses, assumptions, p-values, and interpretations.  
Multiple Linear Regression Analysis:
 Predict AmountSpent using independent variables such as:
 Age, AnnualIncome, ItemsPurchased, Membership, Gender, etc.    

Include:
Regression coefficients
R-squared value
Residual plots and model assumptions
Interpretation of coefficients and model quality
Final Report & Interpretation:
1. Summarize key findings.
2. Provide actionable insights for the eCommerce business:
               i) Customer spending behavior
               ii) Impact of membership and demographics on sales
               iii) Return behavior analysis

Retail Fashion E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis (Bangladesh)
This project presents an in-depth analysis of customer behavior and sales trends for a fictional retail fashion e-commerce platform based in Bangladesh. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and building a predictive model using multiple linear regression.

Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized records of customer transactions. Key features include:
•	Age
•	Gender
•	Annual Income
•	Items Purchased
•	Membership Level
•	Satisfaction Rating
•	Return Status
•	Product Category
•	Payment Method
•	Amount Spent

Tools & Libraries
•	Programming Language: Python 3.x
•	Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
•	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Statistical Testing & Modeling: Scikit-learn, statsmodels, SciPy
•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Project Tasks
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
•	Detection and treatment of missing values
•	Outlier identification
•	Encoding of categorical variables
•	Conversion of data types for modeling
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Summary statistics
•	Distribution plots and comparisons
•	Correlation analysis and cross-tabulations
3. Statistical Hypothesis Testing
•	Relationship between Gender and Return Behavior
•	Testing Gender-based differences in Amount Spent
•	Comparing Membership Levels in terms of spending
4. Regression Analysis
•	Built a Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict AmountSpent
•	Model evaluation using R² score and residual plots
•	Interpretation of regression coefficients to assess feature impact
5. Key Findings & Insights
•	Clear patterns in customer spending behavior
•	Significant influence of Membership Level on purchase volume
•	Gender-based variation observed in return frequency and purchase amount
